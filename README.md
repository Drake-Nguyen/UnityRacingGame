## Details
This game was made and developed in Unity's game engine for a class project. The game is a simple racing game that currently features 5 different Tracks with a unique car for each race track.
The objective of the game is to finish any racetrack with a given racecar, and win. You can also try to beat your best lap time's.
Some assets used are taken from the unity store, and made without any commercial use.

# Playing The Game
### Due to the large nature of making a game and the assets there within, we cannot post the full files for every OS version, since GitHub only allows a max size of 2GB for file sharing for free accounts on Repos.
As a result, heres the required links and steps necessary to play the game on your preferred format:
